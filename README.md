Two wheeled robot destined for vacuuming my room

Uses the TB6612FNG 2 Channel motor driver breakout board and homemade wheel encoders for position feedback.

Uses differential drive and a third omnidirectional tail wheel to drive the robot forward and spin, simultaneously if desired.  The robot will ideally have various sensors and sufficient localization and mapping software to find its way around my room to vaccuum efficiently, then return to a charging station.  It should run autonomously.
